# Mandarin Feature Design

The Mandarin feature provides vocabulary learning, flashcards, review, and daily commitment tracking.

## Data

- Each word includes: character, pinyin, meaning, example sentence, and translations.

## Main Components

- **Basic**: Basic component for displaying vocabulary.
- **DailyCommitment**: Lets users set and track daily word learning goals.
- **FlashCard**: Displays a word and its details, allows audio playback.

## Pages

## Routing

## Design Notes

- Uses React functional components and hooks.
- Data is kept in local state and loaded from static files.
